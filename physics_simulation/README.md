Some Python implementations of various idea of physics

What I have done:
- weighing pendulum
- double weighing pendulum
- heat transfer in one dimension (x-axis) in a rod

Next ideas:
- triple (and n) weighing pendulum
- heat transfer in 2D (and in 3D)
- An autonomeous car that drive itself around a circuit
- circulation simulation around a traffic light
